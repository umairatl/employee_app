This is a new [**React Native**](https://reactnative.dev) project, bootstrapped using [`@react-native-community/cli`](https://github.com/react-native-community/cli).

# Getting Started

## Step 1: Clone project & npm i & pod install

## Step 2:  Start the Metro Server

First, you will need to start **Metro**, the JavaScript _bundler_ that ships _with_ React Native.

To start Metro, run the following command from the _root_ of your React Native project:

````bash
# using npm
npm start

## Step 2: Start your Application

Let Metro Bundler run in its _own_ terminal. Open a _new_ terminal from the _root_ of your React Native project. Run the following command to start your _Android_ or _iOS_ app:
````

### For iOS

```bash
# using npm
npm run ios

# OR using Yarn
yarn ios
````

### For Android

```bash
# using npm
npm run android

# OR using Yarn
yarn android
````

If everything is set up _correctly_, you should see your new app running in your _Android Emulator_ shortly provided you have set up your emulator/simulator correctly.

This is one way to run your app â€” you can also run it directly from within Android Studio respectively.
